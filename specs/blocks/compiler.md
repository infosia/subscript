# Compiler and runtime — contract

Status: Rev 4, 2026-07-22 (Rev 0: same day; Rev 1 moves the mobile link
spike from P3 to P0.5 — plan §8; Rev 2 adds the §6 P1 checker contract;
Rev 3 adds the §7 P2 runtime/JIT contract; Rev 4 adds the §8 P3
AOT/reload contract). Contract for the plan's P0.5–P5 phases
(`specs/subscript-project-plan.md` §6). Evidence lands in
`specs/tracking/<phase>.md`.

## 1. Architecture

```
SWC parse (TS-subset front end, Rust)
  → semantic checker (C1–C8 + Q rules; rule-specific diagnostics, TS positions)
  → typed HIR
      ├─ dev tier: cranelift-jit (Windows/Mac), hot reload
      └─ ship tier: cranelift-object AOT → .o → Xcode / NDK link
                     (aarch64-apple-ios, aarch64-linux-android; arm64-only)
  both call one runtime crate across a C-ABI-stable boundary:
  Context memory (manual delete, explicit collect), values, strings,
  arrays, traps, coroutine state, Q14 numeric formatting
```

- One HIR→CLIF lowering serves both tiers; dev/ship semantics coincide by
  construction.
- **Coroutines**: CPS transform in codegen (iOS-safe; no fibers, no stack
  switching). Suspended state lives in the runtime as Context data.
- **Traps** (OOB, null narrowing, checked `as`, literal-range, failed
  narrowing): explicitly emitted checks calling runtime trap functions —
  no signal/SEH harvesting on any platform. Trap reports carry TS
  positions (the compiler embeds a position table).
- **Hot reload** (dev tier): per-function indirection table; module
  recompiled and swapped at frame boundaries. Reload eligibility is
  conservative: a swap is accepted only when the module's **declaration
  hash** is unchanged — the hash covers every type declaration (value
  and reference class field names/types/order, enum member values,
  `FixedArray` shapes), every module-level variable's name and type, and
  every function signature; only function-body edits reload, anything
  else requires a restart. Suspended coroutines whose function was
  replaced are invalidated: resuming one traps with a
  "stale coroutine after reload" diagnostic. (Both rules are this
  contract's; P3's reload demo must exercise an accepted body edit, a
  rejected layout edit, and a stale-coroutine trap.)
- Cranelift is pinned (exact `wasmtime`-family crate versions in
  `Cargo.lock`); the pin moves deliberately, never as a side effect.

## 2. Oracle: golden corpus outputs

- Scope: the **run set (a01–a24)** gains committed
  `corpus/accept/<id>.expected` files (exact stdout bytes). Future interop
  entries (plan P5) define their goldens when they land.
- Authoring: goldens are derived from the language rules, not copied from
  any external implementation. Entries whose output is fully determined
  by inspection (string literals, small integer arithmetic) are authored
  directly from the corpus program and the Q14 formatting rule at P2.
  Entries whose output is computed (checksums: `a22`–`a24`) are
  **captured** from the dev-JIT tier at P2 after the P2 review, each with
  a tracking entry recording the capture.
- Confirmation: a golden is **frozen** only when P3's AOT tier reproduces
  it byte-exactly — two independently-executed paths through the shared
  lowering must agree. Until freeze, goldens are provisional and a
  disagreement reopens the entry, never auto-updates it.
- Golden-change procedure (after freeze): a change must (1) cite the
  language rule that defines the new bytes and (2) land as an entry in
  the phase tracking file. Goldens are never edited as a side effect of
  making a test pass.
- The standing differential gate (from P3, the default `cargo test`
  path): dev-JIT output ≡ AOT output ≡ golden, byte-exact, every entry
  that has a golden.

## 3. Pre-registered criteria

- **P0.5 mobile link spike — kill criterion**: the spike has no
  dependency on the language (it emits a fixed program), so it runs
  immediately after P0, before any compiler investment. A minimal
  program (arithmetic + a runtime call + printed result) compiled
  through `cranelift-object` must produce a valid object and link cleanly
  with the platform linker for both device triples:
  `aarch64-linux-android` (NDK clang) and `aarch64-apple-ios` (Xcode
  clang). Compile+link is the whole criterion; simulators and emulators
  are not used, and run-level verification on mobile hardware is not
  required — execution semantics are carried by the host-side
  differential gate. Failure at the object or link level for either
  platform → **ship tier reverts to C emission**; dev tier stays
  Cranelift JIT. Environment note: the iOS half requires a Mac; the
  Android half runs on any host via NDK.
- **P4 performance gate**: the baseline is a hand-written C
  implementation of the a22 workload (same shape as corpus.md §4),
  compiled with the platform C compiler at `-O2`, measured on the same
  machine in the same session as the language runs and recorded in the
  tracking file when P4 opens. Criteria: ship-AOT within **1.5×** of the
  C baseline (eval median); dev-JIT within **4×** of the same baseline.
  Failing either reopens the backend decision with the measurement as
  the named criterion.

## 4. Milestones and gates

| # | Deliverable | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| P0.5 | Mobile link spike (`cranelift-object` emitter + runtime stub + link script + host-side object-parse tests) | Spike passes both targets or fallback is invoked and recorded |
| P1 | Semantic checker + typed HIR | All 14 reject entries (r01–r14, plus any added since) rejected with rule-specific diagnostics at TS positions; accept corpus checks clean |
| P2 | Runtime crate + HIR→CLIF + JIT; goldens authored/captured (§2) | Run set (a01–a24) matches goldens under dev JIT |
| P3 | AOT objects + link + run; hot reload demo; standing differential gate; goldens frozen | Run set matches goldens under AOT; JIT≡AOT≡golden is the default `cargo test`; reload demonstrated on a run-set program |
| P4 | Performance gate | §3 criteria |
| P5 | C-header binding slice: mirror generator from a neutral synthetic header (all five plan-§4 patterns), `offsetof` assertion suite, headless end-to-end slice on both forms, interop corpus entries | Slice green headless; layout suite green on dev targets |

## 5. Conventions

CLAUDE.md code conventions apply to all crates (`compiler/`, `runtime/`):
no panics in library code, `///` docs + `#![warn(missing_docs)]`,
`#[must_use]`, `#[non_exhaustive]`, SAFETY comments on every unsafe impl,
unit tests with every public API, one module per area.

## 6. P1 checker contract

Observable obligations only; internal design is the implementer's.

- Crate: `compiler/` (workspace member). Public API at minimum:
  check a set of source files (a19 is two files) → either a typed HIR
  module or a non-empty diagnostic list. `Result`-based; no panics.
- **Diagnostics** carry: a stable rule code (table below), a message, and
  a TS position (file, 1-based line and column) pointing at the
  offending construct. Messages are free-form; codes and positions are
  the tested contract.
- **Rule codes** (stable identifiers; never renumber):

| Code | Rule | Source | Reject entries |
|---|---|---|---|
| S001 | `any` banned | founding | r01 |
| S002 | no dynamic code evaluation (`eval`, `new Function`) | founding | r02, r05 |
| S003 | no prototype mutation | founding | r03 |
| S004 | nominal types are closed | founding | r04 |
| S005 | no structural substitution | C1 | r06 |
| S006 | value classes do not inherit | C2 | r07 |
| S007 | bare `number` rejected | C3 | r08 |
| S008 | integer literal out of range | C4 | r09 |
| S009 | capturing lambda may not escape | C5 | r10 |
| S010 | exceptions are not in the language | C6 | r11 |
| S011 | unions limited to `T \| null` | C7 | r12 |
| S012 | `undefined` banned | C7 | r13 |
| S013 | no `async` / event loop | C8 | r14 |

  Constructs outside the decided surface (e.g. non-whitelisted
  `Array.prototype` / `string` members — collisions.md Q4/Q5) are
  rejected under a catch-all code S100 (`outside the decided surface`)
  with the offending member named in the message.

- **Typed HIR**: every expression carries its resolved type (sized
  numerics distinct from each other; value classes distinct from
  reference classes; nominal identity preserved) and a TS position.
  Monomorphization of the a12 generic shapes may happen in HIR or be
  deferred to P2 lowering — implementer's choice, recorded in the
  tracking file.
- **Gate tests** (in the default `cargo test`): one integration test
  iterates `corpus/reject/` and asserts, per entry, the expected rule
  code (table above) and that the position lands in the entry's file at
  the offending line; one iterates `corpus/accept/` and asserts zero
  diagnostics and a well-formed HIR per entry.
- SWC front end pinned in `Cargo.lock` (`swc_common 5.0.1`-compatible
  family; the Cranelift 0.125.4 serde constraint —
  `specs/tracking/p0.5-mobile-link.md` — binds the choice).

## 7. P2 runtime and JIT contract

Observable obligations only; internal design is the implementer's.

- Crates: `runtime/` (workspace member — the single runtime crate of §1;
  every function callable from generated code is `extern "C"` with a
  stable signature). CLIF lowering and the JIT driver may live in
  `compiler/` or a new member; the choice is recorded in the tracking
  file.
- **Execution API**: given a checked program (P1 HIR), run the exported
  `main(): void` under `cranelift-jit` and return the captured stdout
  **bytes** (print writes to a runtime-owned sink, not the process
  stdout, so tests compare bytes exactly). Outcome is `Result`: normal
  completion with output, or a trap report (rule + TS position); a trap
  never aborts the host process and no signal/SEH handling is used.
- **Runtime semantics** (the run set exercises all of these):
  - Context memory: reference classes, arrays, strings, coroutine
    frames are Context allocations. `unsafeDelete` frees immediately;
    double delete / use-after-delete trap in the dev tier. `collect()`
    frees unreachable allocations and never runs unbidden.
  - Strings: immutable UTF-8 `(ptr, len)`; `length` = byte length
    (`i32`); `slice(start, end)` byte offsets, traps off a UTF-8
    boundary; `+`/template concatenation; `===`/`!==` by content.
  - Arrays: `length`, indexing (OOB traps), `push`, `pop` (empty-pop
    traps).
  - Numerics: two's-complement wrap on i32/u32/i64/u64 arithmetic;
    `as` conversions truncate/wrap per C; **f32 arithmetic is performed
    at f32 precision** (never computed in f64 and rounded — the a22
    checksum depends on it); 64-bit bitwise ops are true 64-bit (Q18).
  - **Q14 formatting** (template-literal interpolation, shared by both
    tiers from P3): integers in decimal; `f32`/`f64` by shortest
    round-trip; spellings exactly `-0`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`
    (a formatter that spells infinity `inf` must be mapped).
  - Coroutines: CPS transform in codegen (§1); suspended state is
    Context data; `.next()` returns `{ done, value }` with `value`
    zero-initialized when `done`.
- **Goldens** (procedure in §2): `corpus/accept/<id>.expected` for
  a01–a21 are authored by inspection from the program and the Q14 rule,
  independently of the implementation, before any output comparison;
  a22–a24 are captured from the dev JIT after the P2 review. The
  differential test (default `cargo test`) compares JIT output to every
  committed `.expected` byte-exactly; a mismatch against an authored
  golden is investigated as a bug on one side and resolved by evidence,
  never by silently editing the golden.
- **Gate** (§4): run set a01–a24 matches goldens under the dev JIT.

## 8. P3 AOT, hot reload, and the standing gate

Observable obligations only; internal design is the implementer's.

### 8.1 AOT tier

- The **same** `lower_module` instantiated with `cranelift-object`
  (§1: one lowering, both tiers). A lowering change that helps one tier
  and not the other is a contract violation, not an optimization.
- Host-target AOT (the machine running CI) is the gate path: emit an
  object, link it with the runtime staticlib and a small C or Rust
  entry that calls the program's `main` and writes the Context sink
  bytes to stdout, run it, capture stdout bytes.
- Device-triple AOT (`aarch64-apple-ios`, `aarch64-linux-android`)
  must still **compile and link** for a run-set entry — the P0.5 spike
  proved a minimal program; P3 proves the real lowering's output links.
  No device execution is required (P0.5 criterion, unchanged).
- Cross-tier determinism: the AOT binary's stdout bytes must equal the
  JIT's for every run-set entry. Where they differ, the language rule
  decides which side is wrong (§2), never the golden.

### 8.2 Hot reload (dev tier)

Per §1's rules, made testable:

- **Declaration hash** over: every value/reference class (field names,
  types, order), enum member values, `FixedArray` shapes, every
  module-level variable's name and type, every function signature
  (name, parameter types, return type). Function *bodies* are excluded
  by construction. The hash is computed from the typed HIR, is stable
  across recompiles of identical declarations, and changes for any
  declaration edit.
- **Accepted swap**: same declaration hash → the per-function
  indirection table is repointed at the newly compiled bodies. Context
  state (globals, live allocations) survives; execution continues.
- **Rejected swap**: different declaration hash → the swap is refused
  with a diagnostic naming the first differing declaration; the running
  program is untouched (a refused reload never corrupts a live
  Context).
- **Stale coroutines**: a coroutine suspended in a function whose body
  was replaced is invalidated; resuming it traps with a
  `stale coroutine after reload` report carrying the resume position.
- **Frame boundary**: swaps are applied only between host calls into
  script (no swap while script code is on the stack). The demo drives
  this explicitly.
- **Demo** (a test, not a script): exercises all three cases — an
  accepted body edit whose new behaviour is observed in output, a
  rejected layout edit, and a stale-coroutine trap.

### 8.3 Standing differential gate and golden freeze

- The default `cargo test` path gains: for every run-set entry with a
  committed golden, **dev-JIT bytes ≡ AOT bytes ≡ golden bytes**.
  Byte-exact; no normalization; a missing AOT toolchain fails the test
  rather than skipping it (the gate machine is the dev machine).
- On green, the a22–a24 goldens captured at P2 are **frozen** (§2): the
  tracking entry records the confirmation, and later changes follow the
  golden-change procedure.

### 8.4 Gate (§4)

Run set matches goldens under AOT; JIT≡AOT≡golden is the default
`cargo test`; reload demonstrated on a run-set program; device-triple
link green for a run-set entry.
