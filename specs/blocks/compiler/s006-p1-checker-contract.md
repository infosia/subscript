## 6. P1 checker contract

Observable obligations only; internal design is the implementer's.

- Crate: `compiler/` (workspace member). Public API at minimum:
  check a set of source files (a19 is two files) → either a typed HIR
  module or a non-empty diagnostic list. `Result`-based; no panics.
- **Diagnostics** carry: a stable rule code (table below), a message, and
  a TS position (file, 1-based line and column) pointing at the
  offending construct. Messages are free-form; codes and positions are
  the tested contract.
- **Rule codes** (stable identifiers; never renumber):

| Code | Rule | Source | Reject entries |
|---|---|---|---|
| S001 | `any` banned | founding | r01 |
| S002 | no dynamic code evaluation (`eval`, `new Function`) | founding | r02, r05 |
| S003 | no prototype mutation | founding | r03 |
| S004 | nominal types are closed | founding | r04 |
| S005 | no structural substitution | C1 | r06 |
| S006 | value classes do not inherit | C2 | r07 |
| S007 | bare `number` rejected | C3 | r08 |
| S008 | integer literal out of range | C4 | r09 |
| S009 | capturing lambda may not escape | C5 | r10 |
| S010 | exceptions are not in the language | C6 | r11 |
| S011 | unions limited to `T \| null` | C7 | r12 |
| S012 | `undefined` banned | C7 | r13 |
| S013 | no `async` / event loop | C8 | r14 |
| S016 | unknown name (type, value, or import) | §82.2 | r174, r175 |
| S017 | duplicate declaration in one namespace | §82.2, C14 | r146, r149–r151, r164 |
| S018 | unknown member of a receiver type | §82.2 | r176 |

  Constructs outside the decided surface (e.g. non-whitelisted
  `Array.prototype` / `string` members — collisions.md Q4/Q5) are
  rejected under a catch-all code S100 (`outside the decided surface`)
  with the offending member named in the message. S014 is the
  standard-library subset code (§15). S015 is retired (§33.4) and is
  never reused. S016–S018 were added 2026-09-02 (§82.2).

- **Typed HIR**: every expression carries its resolved type (sized
  numerics distinct from each other; value classes distinct from
  reference classes; nominal identity preserved) and a TS position.
  Monomorphization of the a12 generic shapes may happen in HIR or be
  deferred to P2 lowering — implementer's choice, recorded in the
  tracking file.
- **Gate tests** (in the default `cargo test`): one integration test
  iterates `corpus/reject/` and asserts, per entry, the expected rule
  code (table above) and that the position lands in the entry's file at
  the offending line; one iterates `corpus/accept/` and asserts zero
  diagnostics and a well-formed HIR per entry.
- SWC front end pinned in `Cargo.lock` (`swc_common 5.0.1`-compatible
  family; the Cranelift 0.125.4 serde constraint —
  `specs/tracking/p0.5-mobile-link.md` — binds the choice).
