## 2. Oracle: golden corpus outputs

- Scope: the **run set (a01–a24)** gains committed
  `corpus/accept/<id>.expected` files (exact stdout bytes). Future interop
  entries (plan P5) define their goldens when they land.
- Authoring: goldens are derived from the language rules, not copied from
  any external implementation. Entries whose output is fully determined
  by inspection (string literals, small integer arithmetic) are authored
  directly from the corpus program and the Q14 formatting rule at P2.
  Entries whose output is computed (checksums: `a22`–`a24`) are
  **captured** from the dev-JIT tier at P2 after the P2 review, each with
  a tracking entry recording the capture.
- Confirmation: a golden is **frozen** only when P3's AOT tier reproduces
  it byte-exactly — two independently-executed paths through the shared
  lowering must agree. Until freeze, goldens are provisional and a
  disagreement reopens the entry, never auto-updates it.
- Golden-change procedure (after freeze): a change must (1) cite the
  language rule that defines the new bytes and (2) land as an entry in
  the phase tracking file. Goldens are never edited as a side effect of
  making a test pass.
- The standing differential gate (from P3, the default `cargo test`
  path): dev-JIT output ≡ AOT output ≡ golden, byte-exact, every entry
  that has a golden.
