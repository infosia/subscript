# Cross-language benchmarks — captured results

Snapshot captured 2026-07-27. Measured live by the runner (`benchmarks/src/bin/cross-language.rs`), never hardcoded; re-run with `cargo run --offline --release -p subscript-benchmarks --bin cross-language`. Contract: `specs/blocks/benchmarks.md`.

## Machine

- host: aarch64 / macos
- CPU: aarch64 (8 logical cores)
- power: AC Power

## Runtimes

- **C**: Apple clang version 21.0.0 (clang-2100.1.1.101)
- **subscript**: subscript @ 7f84729 (dev-JIT: Cranelift; ship: HIR->C->clang)
- **LuaJIT**: LuaJIT 2.1.1784580905 -- Copyright (C) 2005-2026 Mike Pall. https://luajit.org/
- **JSC**: JavaScriptCore (macOS 26.5.2)
- **V8 (Node.js)**: Node.js v24.18.0

## Method

Every subject that runs discards at least 3 warm-up iterations and continues until measured workload execution reaches the 200 ms floor, then performs 11 timed runs and reports the median. `--warmup` is the minimum iteration count; the time floor is always additional. The runner rejects a subject that reports less than the floor or fewer than the requested iterations. Only workload execution is timed. C is the 1.00x reference; every other subject is `ratio (median)`. C, LuaJIT, JSC, and V8 self-time and report every sample; the two subscript tiers are timed by the runner (the language has no clock primitive). Every subject that runs computes the identical integer checksum for a workload — unavailable subjects contribute no checksum, and the runner withholds a workload's timings if any measured checksum differs.

**Span note.** The C/LuaJIT/JSC/V8 subjects time only the `workload()` call and print the checksum afterward; the two subscript tiers time the whole exported `main()`, which includes formatting and writing the one-line integer checksum to the runtime sink. That is a sub-microsecond step inside subscript's span but outside the others' — a conservative difference that penalizes subscript, retained because the ship-tier AOT timing entry and `jit_bench` are shared with the P4 performance gate and time the exported entry by contract.

## Results

| Workload | Checksum | C | subscript-ship | subscript-jit | LuaJIT | JSC | V8 (Node.js) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| collect | 1332546592 | 1.00x (33.931 ms) | 6.28x (213.256 ms) | 6.67x (226.360 ms) | 3.83x (129.993 ms) | 1.00x (33.780 ms) | 2.60x (88.320 ms) |

## Measured warm-up

| Workload | C | subscript-ship | subscript-jit | LuaJIT | JSC | V8 (Node.js) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| collect | 0.228 s (6 iterations) | 0.653 s (3 iterations) | 0.707 s (3 iterations) | 0.397 s (3 iterations) | 0.210 s (6 iterations) | 0.309 s (3 iterations) |

**collect interpretation.** This is not a cross-runtime “GC speed” claim; it compares reclaiming the pinned graph in each runtime's own explicit idiom. Ran: C, subscript-ship, subscript-jit, LuaJIT, JSC, V8 (Node.js). Could not run: none. Failed: none.

## Workload parameters

- **collect** — N=20000 nodes x K=6 rounds from LCG state=state*1664525+1013904223 (seed 0x12345678); each 48-byte node owns unique strings of lengths 9/41/105/233 bytes (subscript requests 17/49/113/241 bytes, one byte past size-class payload capacities 16/48/112/240); keep exactly the nodes with (state&3)!=0 (15000 survivors/round), drop the rest, force collection (C: explicitly free), then traverse the surviving reverse-built chain; checksum per survivor in traversal order is checksum=(checksum*31+state+9+41+105+233) with i32 wrap; final checksum=1332546592

Noise: every recorded sample set is within +/-20% of its median.
